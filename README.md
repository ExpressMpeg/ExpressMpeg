## Install 

#### ðŸ’¾ Installing ExpressMpeg is very simple.<br> 

- Click on one of these files downwards. (The last version is the best one!!!)

- Press the `Install` button. 
- Wait while the installer copies all its files. 
- Press `Finished` button. 

Tadam! The beautiful window of expressmpeg appears. Please refer to [Quick Start](#quick-start) to begin converting.
